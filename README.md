# HDB-resale-transactions
Explore hotspots and the resiliency of HDB prices using this kepler.gl visualisation of HDB resale transactions.

Visualisation provides a high level understanding of price changes, and guides analysts in narrowing down their research for deeper analyses into price trends across towns and flat sizes.

I personally prefer to set the time playback to _incremental time window_ to show changes over time. At a glance, interesting observations can be made such as the effectiveness of 2018 cooling measures.

You can also download the cleaned files and enjoy!
